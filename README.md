# tzaph's academic resources

A website with content of multiple subjects. Most of these are personal notes, and thus not professional writing and may contain. Please also refer to more professional (and proofread) sources which I will link to the corresponding subjects, or simply consult with me via contact or opening GitHub issues.

## What subjects?

Idk lol, but birdwatching stuff will be here for sure.

## Want to discuss and contribute?

Open up an issue in this github repository. Please tag your issues (clarification of content, problem discussion, content addition, content improvement, etc.). For Indonesian speakers, you are free to open an issue with Bahasa Indonesia.

For contribution, as this website is mostly about my personal notes, your contribution will be subject to my personal opinion.

## Want to make a static website like this?
